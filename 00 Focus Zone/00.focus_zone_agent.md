## Scheduling Rules

### When Entering This Zone

1. Prioritize reading `_this_week.md` to get current work context
2. If need to understand workflow, read `_workflow_guide.md`
3. When encountering unclear names, consult `_alias_map.md`

### Monday (Cycle Start)

- Check if `_this_week.md` has been updated
- If not updated, remind user to do week startup
- Based on dictated content, break down tasks, search vault materials

### Weekend (Cycle End)

- Remind user to archive
- Confirm this week's outputs, list items to be archived
- Confirm archiving locations, move documents
- **★ Execute memory-review skill**: Agent shows user this week's memory operation list, calibrates memory strategy through interview, writes results to `MEMORY_LOG.md`
- Assist in renaming `_this_week.md` and moving to `_archive/`
- Create new week file from `_template_this_week.md` (inherit unfinished tasks + memory system's iteration actions)

### Schedule Generation

- When user provides time arrangements, generate `.ics` file
- File naming format: `{{year}}-W{{week}}_schedule.ics`

## Relationship with Global Rules

- This agent's rules **override** AGENTS.md's general rules
- This zone's `_this_week.md` is Layer 1 (working memory) of the global memory system
- This zone's `MEMORY_LOG.md` records the memory system's own runtime state
- During archiving, triggers `memory-review` skill, coordinating with root directory's MEMORY.md (Layer 2) and PROCEDURES.md (Layer 3)
- Archived week records can be accessed by global search
