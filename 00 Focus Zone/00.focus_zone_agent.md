## Scheduling Rules

### When Entering This Zone

1. Prioritize reading `_this_week.md` to get current work context
2. If need to understand workflow, read `_workflow_guide.md`
3. When encountering unclear names, consult `_alias_map.md`

### Monday (Cycle Start)

- Check if `_this_week.md` has been updated
- If not updated, remind user to do week startup
- Based on dictated content, break down tasks, search vault materials

### Weekend (Cycle End)

- Remind user to archive
- Confirm this week's outputs, list items to be archived
- Confirm archiving locations, move documents
- **★ Execute memory-review skill**: Agent shows user this week's memory operation list, calibrates memory strategy through interview, writes results to `MEMORY_LOG.md`
- Assist in renaming `_this_week.md` and moving to `_archive/`
- Create new week file from `_template_this_week.md` (inherit unfinished tasks + memory system's iteration actions)

## Calendar Generation

### Trigger

After user's ToDo discussion is complete, proactively guide them to create calendar events:

```
Task list is ready. I noticed some tasks have time arrangements:

1. Wednesday 10:00-12:00 Client meeting
2. Friday 14:00 deadline - Submit proposal

Would you like me to generate a calendar file you can import into your calendar app?
```

### Process

1. **Confirm schedule details**:
   - Specific date and time
   - Duration (default 1 hour if not provided)
   - Event title
   - Description (optional)

2. **Generate .ics file**:
   - File naming: `{{year}}-W{{week}}_schedule.ics`
   - Location: `00 Focus Zone/`
   - Timezone: `Asia/Shanghai` (or user's timezone)

3. **Guide user to import**:
   ```
   Calendar file generated: {{year}}-W{{week}}_schedule.ics

   Import methods:
   - macOS Calendar: Double-click file, or drag into Calendar app
   - Google Calendar: Settings → Import & export → Import
   - Outlook: File → Open & Export → Import/Export

   Need me to adjust any events?
   ```

## Relationship with Global Rules

- This agent's rules **override** AGENTS.md's general rules
- This zone's `_this_week.md` is Layer 1 (working memory) of the global memory system
- This zone's `MEMORY_LOG.md` records the memory system's own runtime state
- During archiving, triggers `memory-review` skill, coordinating with root directory's MEMORY.md (Layer 2) and PROCEDURES.md (Layer 3)
- Archived week records can be accessed by global search
