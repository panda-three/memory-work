## The Problem

When you're juggling 10+ parallel projects, traditional AI assistants make things worse:

- **AI amnesia**: Every conversation starts from scratch. You repeat context endlessly.
- **You become the bottleneck**: Ideas → *you* structure → *you* input → *you* maintain
- **Knowledge base becomes burden**: The bigger it gets, the harder to manage

---

## The Solution

**Memory Work** flips the script:

- Ideas → **just dictate** → AI structures → AI maintains
- AI reads layered files at startup → **no more amnesia**
- Divide-and-conquer agents → **scales to any vault size**

**You only do two things: provide attention focus, make creative decisions.**

AI handles the rest: integrating history, matching materials, structured output.

## How It Works in Claude Code

### First Run: Smart Initialization

When you clone this repo and open it in Claude Code, the AI automatically:

```
1. Detects it's a fresh installation
2. Asks your preferred language (中文 / English)
3. Collects your basic info to create your profile
4. Creates your first week's workspace
5. Shows you how to open in Obsidian
6. Asks: "What do you want to work on this week?"
```

**You don't configure anything manually.** Just talk.

*Step 1: Language selection and file initialization*

*Step 2: Voice-first user profile configuration*

</div>

### Daily Usage: Voice-First Workflow

```
You: "This week I need to finish the proposal, prep for Wednesday's
     client meeting, and that partnership agreement needs follow-up."

Claude:
1. Breaks into 3 tasks, writes to _this_week.md
2. Searches your vault for related materials
3. Asks you to clarify uncertainties
4. Proactively asks: "Want me to generate a calendar file?"
```

You dictate naturally. Claude structures. **Your flow state stays protected.**

### Calendar Generation

After discussing tasks, Claude proactively guides you to create calendar events:

```
Claude: "Tasks are organized. I noticed some have time arrangements:
         1. Wednesday 10:00-12:00 Client meeting
         2. Friday 14:00 deadline - Submit proposal

         Want me to generate a calendar file you can import?"

You: "Sure, the client meeting is 10:00 to 11:30"

Claude: [Generates 2026-W06_schedule.ics]
        "Calendar file generated. Double-click to import to macOS Calendar,
         or use 'Import' in Google Calendar."
```

### Weekly Rhythm

```
Monday          →        Mid-week        →         Friday
   │                        │                        │
   ▼                        ▼                        ▼
┌─────────┐           ┌─────────┐            ┌─────────┐
│ Dictate │           │ Progress│            │ Archive │
│   ↓     │           │   ↓     │            │   ↓     │
│AI struct│ ────────▶ │AI assist│ ─────────▶ │AI review│
│   ↓     │           │   ↓     │            │   ↓     │
│Schedule │           │ Output  │            │New week │
└─────────┘           └─────────┘            └─────────┘
```

| Phase | You Do | Claude Does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Monday** | Dictate what you want to do | Structure tasks, pull materials, generate calendar |
| **Mid-week** | Work, add notes anytime | Track progress, search vault, assist decisions |
| **Friday** | Give feedback on memories | Calibrate memory, archive, create next week |

## Four-Layer Memory Architecture

The core mechanism that solves AI amnesia. Inspired by [Titans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663) (surprise-driven) and [MemSkill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03313) (evolvable memory).

```
Layer 0 · Persistent    SOUL.md / USER.md       Who you are, who AI is
Layer 1 · Working       _this_week.md           Current week's focus
Layer 2 · Dynamic       MEMORY.md               Cross-week insights, with lifecycle
Layer 3 · Procedural    PROCEDURES.md           "When X happens, do Y" patterns
```

### How Memory Evolves

```
Conversation → AI detects "surprise" → Proposes to remember
                      ↓
          You confirm → Memory saved with metadata
                      ↓
          Weekly review → Calibrate usefulness → Strengthen or decay
```

**Surprise-driven**: Only writes when something deviates from known patterns. No noise.

**User-confirmed**: AI proposes, you approve. Nothing written without consent.

**Has lifecycle**: Strong memories persist (★★★), weak ones fade (★☆☆ → archive after 4 weeks inactive).

## Focus Zone: Your Attention Anchor

The `00 Focus Zone/` (or `00 专注区/`) is the heart of the system:

```
00 Focus Zone/
├── _this_week.md      ← Your current attention focus
│   ├── Original dictation (your raw thoughts)
│   ├── Task list (AI-structured)
│   ├── Reference materials (AI-searched)
│   ├── Progress log (by date)
│   └── To be archived
├── MEMORY_LOG.md      ← Memory system's own journal
├── ITERATION_LOG.md   ← Architecture evolution log
└── _archive/          ← Past weeks
```

**One week, one file.** Archive on Friday, fresh start on Monday. You never manage the backlog—it's always archived and searchable.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yiliqi78/memory-work.git
```

Or download directly: [Download ZIP](https://github.com/yiliqi78/memory-work/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

### 2. Open in Claude Code

```bash
cd memory-work
claude .
```

Or if using Cursor / VS Code with Claude extension:
```bash
cd memory-work
cursor .   # or: code .
```

### 3. Start Talking

Claude will guide you through initialization:

```
Claude: "Welcome to Memory Work! 🎉

        First, choose your language:
        1. 中文
        2. English"

You: "1"

Claude: [Switches to Chinese templates]
        "好的！让我快速了解你：
        1. 你希望我怎么称呼你？
        2. 你的职业是什么？
        3. 目前在做什么项目？"

You: "叫我小明，我是产品经理，在做一个 AI 教育产品"

Claude: [Creates USER.md, MEMORY.md, _本周.md]
        "小明，今天周一，新的一周开始。
        说说这周想推进什么？随便说，我来整理。"
```

### 4. Open in Obsidian (Optional)

For graph view and wiki-links:

1. Open Obsidian
2. "Open folder as vault"
3. Select the cloned `memory-work` folder

## Key Concepts

### Voice-First
Don't structure your thoughts. Just talk. AI handles the organization.

> 💡 **Note**: Memory Work itself doesn't include voice recognition. We recommend pairing it with a voice input tool like [Typeless](https://typeless.app/), [闪电说](https://shurufa.baidu.com/), or any system-level speech-to-text.

### Divide-and-Conquer Agents
Each folder has its own agent file (`00.xxx_agent.md`) with specific rules. Personal archives need item-by-item confirmation. Project files stay isolated. Skills can be freely modified.

### Skill System
Package your workflows as reusable skills. When you solve a problem repeatedly, tell Claude: "Turn this into a skill." Next time, it triggers automatically.

### Self-Evolution
The system gets smarter every week:
- **Memory evolution**: MEMORY_LOG.md tracks what worked
- **Behavior evolution**: PROCEDURES.md accumulates your patterns
- **Architecture evolution**: ITERATION_LOG.md records changes

## Design Philosophy

1. **You provide focus, AI provides structure** — Don't adapt to the tool, let the tool adapt to you
2. **Local-first** — Your data stays on your machine, plain Markdown files
3. **Surprise-driven** — Only remember what's genuinely new
4. **Weekly rhythm** — Time boundaries protect your attention
5. **Evolvable** — System grows with you, not against you

---

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) or Claude Desktop with Projects
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (optional, for graph view)
- **Voice input tool** (recommended): [Typeless](https://typeless.app/), [闪电说](https://shurufa.baidu.com/), or system speech-to-text
